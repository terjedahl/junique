<p>The JUnique library can perform cross-JVM lock operations. It is
mainly intended to prevent a user to run simultaneously more instances
of the same Java application, and it also offers a communication layer
enabling message exchange between different JVMs.</p>
<p>JUnique is based on a <em>user related cross-JVM exclusive
lock</em> concept. Suppose you want to avoid your Java desktop application to
be started more than once by the same user. When the <em>main()</em>
method of your application is called, you can require to JUnique a lock
on a certain ID, i.e. <em>myapplicationid</em>. At the first application
launch that ID will be surely available, and so the lock will be taken.
The obtained lock can be explicitly released with a <em>JUnique.releaseLock()</em>
call, otherwise it will be automatically released when JVM halts. If
another JVM instance (or even the same one) will try to impose a lock on
the same ID, JUnique will return with an <em>AlreadyLockedException</em>,
notifying the instance that another one is currently running. Then
the second instance can choose to abort its start sequence, and
optionally it can send one or more messages to the active one before
exiting.</p>
<p>Please note that a JUnique lock is user-related: two different
users accessing the system at the same time can still run two separate
instances of the same application, since JUnique IDs reside in a user
scope.</p>
<h1>Quickstart</h1>
<p>A sample <em>main()</em> method preventing multiple running
instances of the same application for the same user:</p>
<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
	String appId = &quot;myapplicationid&quot;;
	boolean alreadyRunning;
	try {
		JUnique.acquireLock(appId);
		alreadyRunning = false;
	} catch (AlreadyLockedException e) {
		alreadyRunning = true;
	}
	if (!alreadyRunning) {
		// Start sequence here
	}
}</pre>
<p>A message handling example, transfering arguments from the
aborting instance to the active one:</p>
<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
	String appId = &quot;myapplicationid&quot;;
	boolean alreadyRunning;
	try {
		JUnique.acquireLock(appId, new MessageHandler() {
			public String handle(String message) {
				// A brand new argument received! Handle it!
				return null;
			}
		});
		alreadyRunning = false;
	} catch (AlreadyLockedException e) {
		alreadyRunning = true;
	}
	if (!alreadyRunning) {
		// Start sequence here
	} else {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
			JUnique.sendMessage(appId, args[0]));
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>Real-world examples can be found inside the JUnique distribution
archive.</p>
<h1>Lock ID strategies</h1>
<p>To avoid potential conflicts, it is advisable to choose a fully
qualifying lock ID for each application using JUnique. Using a generic
ID, such &quot;notepad&quot;, &quot;chat&quot; or &quot;myapp&quot;, is
not a good idea. Better to use something like
&quot;myName.myAppName&quot;, and even better it's to pick your
application main class full name as the JUnique lock ID.</p>
